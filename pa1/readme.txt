This is programming assignment 1 for operating systems class.

  The assignment was to change the delete function of the code
to be more like the "tasty" style of Linus Torvalds reverenced
in the assignment details. Essentially, the idea was to use pointers
to get rid of the if conditions i.e. special cases of deleting
the head node, end node, middle node.

The original code comes from:
